FLAMP(1)
=========


== NAME ==
flamp - AMP file transfer utility for use with fldigi


== SYNOPSIS ==
*flamp* ['OPTIONS']


== DESCRIPTION ==
*Flamp* (fast light automatic repeat request) is a file transfer application
that is based on the Amateur Multicast Protocol originally developed by 
Walt Fair, Jr., W5ALT, and updated by Dave Freese, W1HKJ. It is capable
of transmitting and receiving frames of AMP data via fldigi, as well.


== OPTIONS ==
Long options begin with two hyphens and are handled by flamp. The option names
may be abbreviated to any unambiguous substring, and the option argument may be
separated from the name by a space or equals sign, as per +getopt(3)+.

Short options begin with a single hyphen and are passed directly to FLTK. They
may be abbreviated only as indicated.

  Print version information and exit.

*--help*::
  Print options summary and exit.
